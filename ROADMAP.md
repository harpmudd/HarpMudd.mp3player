# Roadmap

Things worth doing next, with enough context that picking one up doesn't mean
re-deriving why it's on the list. Ordered by value per effort, not by ambition.

## PNG album art

The cover-art decoder is [picojpeg](third_party/picojpeg/), baseline JPEG only.
`art_find_apic()` checks the APIC frame's MIME type and skips anything that
isn't JPEG, so a PNG cover shows the placeholder rather than failing oddly —
correct, but a real gap: PNG is common in tags written by iTunes and by several
taggers.

What it needs:

- **A PNG decoder that fits.** PNG is DEFLATE plus per-line filters. The
  decoder must stream, because the art path already streams JPEG — nothing here
  can hold a 300×300 RGB image in RAM (that's 270 KB against a 256 KB budget
  already 63% used). [uPNG](https://github.com/elanthis/upng) is the usual
  small-target choice; it decodes to a full buffer, so it would need adapting
  to emit rows, or a bounded-window rewrite.
- **A ~32 KB inflate window.** DEFLATE back-references reach 32 KB, so unlike
  JPEG's 8×8 blocks there is no way to decode PNG with a small fixed buffer.
  That window is the real cost and the reason this isn't a quick job. The MP3
  ring is 32 KB and is free during a load — worth checking whether it can be
  borrowed, since art decoding happens in the silent gap before playback.
- **Row-wise downscale, matching the JPEG path.** `art_emit_row()` already
  takes a row of RGB565 and RLE-encodes it into the SDRAM stash; a PNG decoder
  that produces rows can reuse it unchanged.
- **No 1/8-scale shortcut.** picojpeg's reduce mode decodes one pixel per 8×8
  block, which is why a 600×600 cover costs almost nothing. PNG has no
  equivalent — every pixel must be inflated and unfiltered before it can be
  discarded. Expect the decode to be substantially slower than JPEG's ~207 ms.

Where it goes: `fw/art.inc`, beside `art_find_apic()`. The MIME check already
distinguishes the two formats, so the dispatch point exists.

Worth measuring first: how many covers in a real library are actually PNG. If
it's a handful, the effort is better spent elsewhere.

## Gapless playback

Track changes currently have a short silence — the new file has to be opened,
its tag read and its art decoded before a note plays. Removing it means
decoding the next track's opening frames *while* the current one is still
playing, which needs a second decoder instance (~34 KB heap) and a second ring.
Memory is the constraint, not logic.

## Spectrum display

The decoder doesn't expose frequency bins, so every meter shows loudness,
waveform or stereo. Real frequency content needs either an FFT or a few
one-pole IIR filters over the PCM buffer to split bass/mid/treble. The filter
bank is affordable (a few hundred MACs a frame, subsampled) but lands in the
budget that keeps the decoder fed — the one item on this list that could bring
audio tics back. Prototype behind a compile-time flag.

## MPEG-2 / 2.5 and Layer I/II

Helix decodes them; the core rejects them. Mostly a matter of not assuming
MPEG-1 Layer III in the frame-size arithmetic (`144 * bitrate / samplerate`),
the duration estimate and the oscilloscope's trigger window. Low risk, low
excitement, widens the library.

## Playlist browsing on screen

`0192` opens a file by name and works. The missing piece is showing the list:
the names are already parsed into `pl_text[]`, so this is a UI job — a
scrollable list, and a decision about whether it overlays the now-playing
screen or replaces it.

## Confirm the settings-write mitigation

Twice, every `.mp3` sharing a directory with `settings.bin` came back reporting
the same wrong size while its audio stayed intact — the signature of a damaged
directory entry. The file now lives alone in `settings/`, on the theory that a
directory sector rewrite can then only catch our own file.

**This is reasoned, not proven.** If `.mp3` sizes ever converge on one value
again, set `SETTINGS_WRITE` to 0 first and investigate second. The full
reasoning is at that definition in [fw/settings.inc](fw/settings.inc).

## Cleanup: retire what the click hunt left behind

Fixing the track-change click took many attempts, and several mechanisms
survive that may no longer earn their place — the decoder reservoir warm-up and
the async EOF discovery are the likeliest candidates, now that every cold load
finishes through the reposition body. Others are load-bearing: the FIFO
glide/fade pair, the cut-at-press transition, and the confirmed-EOF guard all
fix real faults. Worth a pass, one at a time, each verified on hardware —
not a bulk tidy.
