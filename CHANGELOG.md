# Changelog

What changed in each release, newest first.

## v1.2.0

- Resume now works with **any** playlist, not just `playlist.m3u` — it
  remembers which list you were in.
- New meter: a **magic eye**, a pair of EM84 tubes that light the panel. Press
  **X** to reach it.
- Files with no ID3 tag show their **filename** instead of a placeholder.
- Switching playlists now shows a loading indicator and pauses while it
  works, so a slow load no longer looks like a failed one.
- Fixed: long titles painted through the info panel's border.
- Fixed: the startup screen flickered.

## v1.1.0 — 11 August 2026

- **Resume where you left off** in a playlist — the track and your position in
  it. Switch it on in Core Settings.
- **1.2× playback speed** for spoken word. Hold **A**.
- Screen blanking moved to **Select + Down**.
- The album art panel and the screen-blank timeout are no longer remembered
  between launches — their saved slots went to resume. Everything else carries
  over from v1.0.0.
- Fixed: seeking landed in the wrong place on files with no Xing header, and
  their total time was wrong too.
- Fixed: Load MP3 could lose your pick to a playlist reload.

## v1.0.0 — 10 August 2026

First public release. Plays your own MP3s off the SD card, with album art, ID3
tags, nine meters, an eight-preset equalizer and playlists.
